# Netflix clone

<br/>

This is a project that intends to clone the Netflix homepage. To build this page, i use ReactJs features like components and useState. This project is also responsive. The project was made watching a YouTube video from Bonieki Lacerda.

It is worth mentioning that, when cloning the repository, it is necessary to use the ```yarn``` command to load the modules and configure the application. After that, just run the ```yarn start``` command to launch the software on localhost.
